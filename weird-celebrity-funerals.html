The actor had been just 52 years old when he died after a massive stroke.</p><p>Later that year, his daughter Sophie revealed another surprising piece of information about the late actor: He had been buried in an eco-friendly mushroom suit.</p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener>CNN</a> reported, Perry had become something of an environmentalist over the course of his life, and eventually came across a United States company that was working on biodegradable burial garments.</p><p>“My dad discovered it, and was more excited by this than I have ever seen him. He was buried in this suit, one of his final wishes. They are truly a beautiful thing for this beautiful planet, and I want to share it with all of you,” Sophie Perry wrote in an Instagram post.</p><p>The company that designed Perry’s suit was Coeio, who explained that its Infinity Burial Suit has a built-in “biomix” made up of mushrooms and microorganisms that work to decompose the body, “neutralize toxins,” and help surrounding plant life get nutrients from the body.</p><p>Luke Perry is possibly the most famous person to be buried in such a way, but he is far from the only person to do so. Mushroom suits are a fairly inexpensive burial method, especially compared to coffins, and are only becoming more widely available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony4scirm2ablaGyo77IrbBmnqWjsrOty6xmbw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
