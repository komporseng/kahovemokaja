Then come former <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Manchester United</a> pair Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie and, most recently, Salah.</p><p>The Egyptian is the only player to have&nbsp;won it in three consecutive months while <a href=#>Bruno Fernandes</a> became the first player with four wins in a calendar year in 2020.</p><p>As a club, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=655 href=#>Manchester United</a> have the most Player of the Months wins with 45. Although, after <a class=ath_autolink data-id=KM98BOcjxMZ919HO href=#>Bukayo Saka</a> was handed the award back in March, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=651 href=#>Arsenal</a> have the most individual winners with 22.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The players to have won the award three times or more are as follows:</p><ul><li>7 — Sergio Aguero & <a class=ath_autolink data-id=47vQtg5y5Ub8iFqb href=#>Harry Kane</a></li><li>6 — Steven Gerrard & <a class=ath_autolink data-id=jh1IjFA8SnHLGtwM href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a></li><li>5 — Wayne Rooney, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NuvaNMBabDgYuJtn href=#>Mohamed Salah</a>, Robin van Persie</li><li>4 — Dennis Bergkamp, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=qr6VV7sJwbrbqULf href=#>Bruno Fernandes</a>, Thierry Henry, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=i8anqhPOK1u8ImfB href=#>Son Heung-min</a>, Frank Lampard, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Marcus Rashford</a>, Paul Scholes, Alan Shearer, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jamie Vardy</a></li><li>3 — Gareth Bale, Robbie Keane,&nbsp;<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Sadio Mane</a>, Peter Odemwingie,&nbsp;<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Raheem Sterling</a>, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Dwight Yorke,&nbsp;<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ashley Young</a></li></ul><h2>Which players have won the award this season?</h2><h2><strong>How is the manager of the month winner decided?</strong></h2><p>A similar process is used for the Manager of the Month award.</p><p>The fan vote is the same as, like for the player award, it is worth 10 per cent of the decision. However, the captains of each club do not have a say.</p><p>That means the other 90 per cent is determined by the panel who are also involved in the decisions for Player of the Month and Goal of the Month.</p><h2><strong>Which managers have won the award the most?</strong></h2><p>No prizes for guessing this one.</p><p>Sir&nbsp;<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Alex Ferguson</a> is way out on his own in front for the record. During his time at Manchester United, he was awarded the Manager of the Month award 27 times.</p><p>Arsene Wenger (15), Pep Guardiola (11), David Moyes (10) and Jurgen Klopp (9) make up the top five.</p><p>Harry Redknapp is the only manager to have won the award during five separate managerial spells; he won it three times with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Portsmouth</a>&nbsp;across two different spells, another three times with&nbsp;<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tottenham</a>&nbsp;and once each at&nbsp;<a class=ath_autolink href=#>West Ham</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class=ath_autolink href=#>Southampton</a>.</p><p>Guardiola, in 2017, is the only manager to have won the award in four consecutive months while Klopp is the only manager to have won it five times in one season, during <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Liverpool</a>’s triumphant 2019-20 campaign.</p><p>These are the managers that have won the award on five or more occasions:</p><ul><li>27 — Sir Alex Ferguson</li><li>15 — Arsene Wenger</li><li>11 — Pep Guardiola</li><li>10 — David Moyes</li><li>9 — Jurgen Klopp</li><li>8 — Martin O’Neill & Harry Redknapp</li><li>7 — Rafael Benitez</li><li>6 — Sam Allardyce, Mikel Arteta & Bobby Robson</li><li>5 — Carlo Ancelotti, Eddie Howe, Kevin Keegan, Claudio Ranieri</li></ul><h2>Which managers have won the award this season?</h2><ul><li>August 2023 – Ange Postecoglou (Tottenham Hotspur)</li><li>September 2023 – Ange Postecoglou (Tottenham Hotspur)</li><li>October 2023 – Ange Postecoglou (Tottenham Hotspur)</li></ul><p>(Photo: Alex Pantling/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3FscmhobHxzfJFsZmpqX2WFcLzRnqSinaJiuaatxq6cZpmnlr%2Blv4ypo5qxlad6rq3Nmp6eql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
