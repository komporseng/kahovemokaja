Eventually, this became his motivation to turn to the weight room and begin his journey toward success in the field of bodybuilding.</p><p>He began his training life when he was 20 years old.</p><p>Talking about why Chul Soon started getting into fitness, he said</p><p>“When I turned 20 I had a very thin body and weighed only 57kg (125lb). I was treated with disrespect. People looked down at me in situations like if I was returning goods to a store, or helping someone or speaking to strangers.”</p><p>At the beginning of his training, he would do 3000 crunches a day. He did this almost daily. His training sessions would even last more than two or three hours on some days.</p><p>Later on, the bodybuilder realized that this type of training wasn’t the most efficient for building muscle. Subsequently, he started following a structured workout program and also focused on his diet.</p><p>Three years later, he could no longer recognize himself. He found his physique massive, proportionate, and shredded. Eventually, with several years of weightlifting experience, he started working as a personal trainer in one of the gyms in Seoul.</p><p>Later, in the year 2009, he took his career in fitness one step further. He began to compete in bodybuilding shows.</p><p>His debut contest was the 2009 Musclemania World Championships. In this contest, he finished 2nd place in the lightweight category.</p><h4><span>More Details</span></h4><p>Following this, he started competing regularly. He also brought more size and better conditioning as time went on.</p><p>Then by the end of the year 2010, he sculpted an impressive physique and bagged 1st place at the 2010 Musclemania World at Fitness America Weekend contest.</p><p>Since then, the bodybuilder has become a celebrity fitness trainer. He has also appeared in numerous Korean and American commercials, magazines, and TV shows. Talking about his present progress, he says:</p><p>“Now that I am much bigger, people treat me with more respect. They call me the ‘Asian Sensation’, ‘Asian Pride’ and the ‘Asian Arnold’.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-107622 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hwang-Chul-Soon-in-a-before-after-comparison-photo.jpg alt="Hwang Chul Soon" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-107622 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Hwang Chul Soon in a before-after comparison photo.
