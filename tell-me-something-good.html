The lyrics tell the story of a person who is tired of being with someone who is emotionally closed off and puts their pride before everything else. The singer assures this person that they have something within themselves that can set them on fire, that can make them feel something real. The singer is trying to get this person to open up, to tell them something good, something that will bring them closer together.</p><br><p>The repetition of the phrase "Tell me something good" throughout the song emphasizes the desperation of the singer. They want nothing more than to connect with this person on a deeper level and feel something genuine. The line "Your problem is you ain't been loved like you should" reflects the singer's understanding of the root of their partner's emotional distance. The song is ultimately about the healing power of love and the importance of connecting on a real level.</p><br><p>Overall, "Tell Me Something Good" is a powerful and passionate plea for genuine connection over empty words and meaningless actions.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>You ain't got no kind of feeling inside</u><br>You seem to lack any emotions</p><br><p><u>I got something that'll sure 'nough set your stuff on fire</u><br>I have something that will ignite a passion in you</p><br><p><u>You refuse to put anything before your pride, yeah</u><br>You prioritize your ego over everything else</p><br><p><u>Well, what I go will knock all your pride aside</u><br>My offer will be powerful enough to make you forget your ego</p><br><p><u>Tell me something good, yeah</u><br>Share with me something positive, please</p><br><p><u>Tell me that you love me, yeah</u><br>Express your love towards me</p><br><p><u>Tell me something good</u><br>Share another positive thought with me</p><br><p><u>Tell me that you like it, yeah</u><br>Tell me if you enjoy what you have experienced so far</p><br><p><u>"Got no time," is what you're known to say</u><br>You are always busy and never have enough time</p><br><p><u>I'll make you wish there was forty eight hours to each day, yeah</u><br>I'll give you such a fulfilling experience that you'll wish the day never ends</p><br><p><u>Your problem is you ain't been loved like you should</u><br>Your issue is that you haven't experienced love the way you deserve</p><br><p><u>What I got to give will sure 'nough do you good</u><br>My offer will be beneficial for you</p><br><p><u>Tell me something good</u><br>Ask me to share another positive thought</p><br><p><u>Tell me that you love me, yeah</u><br>Ask me to express my love again</p><br><p><u>Tell me something good</u><br>Ask me to share yet another positive thought</p><br><p><u>Tell me that you like it, yeah (you gots to)</u><br>Ask me if you enjoy the experience</p><br><p><u>Tell me something good (ohh, tell me, baby, tell me)</u><br>Ask me one more time to share something positive</p><br><p><u>Tell me that you love me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</u><br>Ask me to repeat my love for you</p><br><p><u>Tell me something good (ohh, tell me, tell me, tell me)</u><br>Ask me to share yet another positive thought</p><br><p><u>Tell me that you like it, yeah, yeah, don't you like it, baby?</u><br>Ask me if you are enjoying the experience</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC<br>Written by: Stevie Wonder</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIqlm8K0e7Oeo6WXfZqslLvMnquhoZ6crIi7zp0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
