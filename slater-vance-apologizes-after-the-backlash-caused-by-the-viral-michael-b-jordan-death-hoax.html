Jordan Death Hoax</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Slater Vance, the son of Black Panther actor Angela Bassett, recently faced controversy after playing the popular Michael B. Jordan death hoax on his mother. The 16-year-old is a rapper and vocalist who posts his songs on Instagram. Angela Bassett’s kid has joined the trendy TikTok fad in which individuals play pranks on others by faking a celebrity death. In the TikTok video, his parents seemed to be preparing to leave the home to go someplace when Vance stopped them and said:</p><p>“Wait, mum and dad, did you…?”</p><p>Did you hear what I said? Michael B. Jordan died at the age of 35.”</p><p>His mother was taken aback when she learned the news. The American Horror Story star was at a lost for words and turned to her kid for confirmation. Angela Bassett and Michael B. Jordan have appeared in the Marvel films Black Panther (2018) and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022). The two are said to be dear friends, so hearing of Jordan’s supposed death was devastating for the 64-year-old actress.</p><p>Courtney B. Vance, Slater’s father, may be heard stating in the background of the hoax video:</p><p>“Stop…you’re just playing.”</p><p>Netizens have blasted this current scam, as well as any other phony celebrity death prank on TikTok. As a result, many chastised Slater for his insensitivity, given that his mother had previously suffered the devastating death of Chadwick Boseman, another of her Black Panther co-stars.</p><h2>Angela Bassett’s son apologized publicly on social media after pulling a cruel prank on his mother.</h2><p>As of this writing, Slater Vance has over 5000 Instagram followers. In September 2021, the rapper released his album Journey 2 Forever, which was one of his most successful albums.&nbsp;On January 27, 2006, he was born through surrogacy in California. Slater and his fraternal twin sister, Bronwyn Vance, were both born nine years after their parents, Courtney B. Vance and Angela Bassett, married. Angela once confessed that her kid has suffered bigotry because of his African-American ancestry from pre-school.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Slater-Vance.jpg alt="Slater Vance" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The 16-year-old rapper played the bogus celebrity death hoax on his mother in order to elicit a bizarre response from her. However, he was unable to comprehend the significance of such a hoax and got unfavorable feedback online.&nbsp;Slater quickly removed the spoof video from his TikTok account. Following that, on January 1, 2023, he went to Instagram to broadcast another video in which he apologized for his involvement in this “destructive” habit. He also expressed regret to Michael B. Jordan and his family. Slater said that Jordan is his hero and that participating in such a prank would be “totally insulting” to him.</p><p>He continued:</p><p>“I don’t intend any adverse implications of my conduct onto his family nor my parents since they deserve none of the wraths. I admit it was a mistake, and I hope this may serve as a lesson to anybody else who utilizes social media as a tool and source of pleasure to actually appreciate that your actions can have far-reaching implications.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Slater-Vance-2.jpg alt="Slater Vance" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Slater apologized again at the conclusion of the video for any harm his actions may have caused Michael B. Jordan, his parents, or anybody else who may have been engaged in the hoax. He closed the video by apologizing profusely.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqpZmkmr9uwsCnmp5lkaW8rbvGorGeq12Ws7Wx0WaroZ1dl66kt8uaqqFlk5bCtLHDZpmyZaSdsm7CyKuYpWWdnrCprcSlZJtlmqS%2Fpa3NZpuemaSdeqm7wLFm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
