After humorously referring to himself as the "white Lizzo," Kreischer revealed he is very comfortable in his skin and is in good shape despite his size.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>During his appearance on the popular YouTube podcast "Chrissy Choas," Kreischer and the podcast host Chris Distefano touched on various topics, including the comedian's self-confidence.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>"I think I look good. I legit do not see my flaws," Kreischer <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/3FYtCIuUi_Y>said</a> before revealing that he felt more comfortable performing shirtless. "You're our Lizzo," Distefano <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/3FYtCIuUi_Y>said</a> before the room exploded in laughter. "White Lizzo," Kreischer humorously <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/3FYtCIuUi_Y>responded</a>.</p><h2 style=text-align:center class=_g><strong class=Ug>Why Does Bert Kreischer Take His Shirt off on Shows?</strong></h2><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>During an interview, Kreischer shared that he started taking his shirt off as a way to remind himself to have fun. The comedian recalled having a few beers before taking off his shirt, hopping on stage, and ensuring he and the audience had a good time.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Kreischer recalled when he removed his shirt during a performance in Columbus, and after 15 minutes, he realized he had not put his shirt back on. When he moved to grab his shirt from the mic stand and redress himself, Kreischer heard a lady in the crowd call out, "Keep it off."</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>When the rest of the audience encouraged him to continue performing shirtless, Kreischer completed his set without a top. After jumping off the stage, Kreischer ran into an admired fellow comedian who <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/I4FLJUkCwjw>told</a> him, "Hey man, I couldn't do one joke with my shirt off. You just did an hour with your shirt off."</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Kreischer has since gone on to have a popular podcast and Netflix series, "The Cabin with Bert Kreischer," which featured<a class="ae -U" href=#> Caitlyn Jenner</a>. And despite misconceptions about his body, Kreischer shared that he is in good shape despite his physique.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>"I am an amazing athlete for someone my size," he <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a34823039/bert-kreischer-exercise-triathlon/>said</a> before sharing that his swing in golf is above the average speed. In 2018,<a class="ae -U" href=#> Bert Kreischer</a> trained rigorously for this first triathlon and <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a34823039/bert-kreischer-exercise-triathlon/>said</a>, "I rode my bike to the pool, I swam at the pool. I then ran two miles, three miles around the trackâ€”and I did not lose a pound."</p>Read also<a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Jacob from 'Twilight' Had $7.5M Film Offer in His Teens Then Hid from Fame Years Later with Nurse Wife</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Lori Brice: Facts about Ron White's First Wife & Mother of His Only Son</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Anderson Cooper Says He Misses His Late Brother Every Day While Raising His Little Look-Alike</h2></a><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>His Netflix series also documents the other unconventional ways <a class="ae -U" href=#>the comedian</a> keeps fit, which include smashing watermelons and plunging in freezing water.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial><i class=Vg><strong class=Ug>Subscribe to AmoMama on </strong></i><a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMJD-kQswipanAw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"><i class=Vg><strong class=Ug>Google News!</strong></i></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1namxlZnqjsdGtZKSqlZ7ApLTEq2ScmZyhwG60yKaqnqSWYsSptdOeZKWhqq%2B8b7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
