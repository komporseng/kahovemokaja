Searching For Jerry Garcia offers none of that. <strong>Proof’s</strong> first solo album is an eclectic mix of styles, flows, topics, etc reminiscent of <strong>Garcia</strong> himself.</p><p>The album centers on <strong>Proof</strong>‘s search for himself, providing a welcomed introspective account of his life, his thoughts, and his mentality. I say ‘welcomed’ because it would have been easy for <strong>D-12s</strong> second most accomplished MC to either a) ride on the coattails of his super platinum mentor and close personal friend <strong>Eminem</strong> b) set out to prove that he’s tighter than people give him credit for c) capitalize on the success of <strong>Shady/Aftermath</strong> by throwing any and everybody hot on the album to guarantee commercial success. <strong>Proof</strong>‘s marked departure from the formula proves that he’s comfortable standing on his own two.</p><p>The album has 20 tracks, each stylistically different from the one before it with guest appearances by <strong>King Gordy, Rude Jude, Obie Trice, 50 Cent, Nate Dogg, 1st Born</strong>, and <strong>T-3</strong>. High rollers features <strong>Proof</strong>‘s rejection of hip hop’s baller lifestyle without sounding preachy, with help from <strong>Method Man</strong>.</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Purple Gang and Pimplikeness is a glimpse of <strong>Proof</strong> with his <strong>D-12 </strong>bretheren, while Jump Biatch actually makes light of suicide. Gurls wit Da Boom is a g’s up/ hoes down track about ass, head, and gold digging. Fittingly, the greatest track on Garcia is Ali, which showcases <strong>MC Breed</strong> and a serious, focused <strong>Proof</strong>. Both are calm yet alert, and <strong>Proof</strong> absolutely dissects the current state of hip hop.</p><p>Let’s get to the source with mics all I need black/cause 5 mics together only makes feedback.</p><p><strong>Jerry Garcia</strong> was a deep dude. Still adored by millions across the world, his legacy is one of peace, drugs, obvious intelligence, and a stubborn willingness to speak his mind. There is little doubt that these are the qualities that <strong>Proof</strong> is searching for, and like much of <strong>Garcia</strong>‘s music, this album may be ahead of its time.</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Album drops August 9th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51kv6bCyJ6urGeZmXt2gZFoq6KsnJp7sb7OqJ1mq5WWv6S0yKeeZp6fp3qrsdGrsGafkaewqq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
