The club is sad to hear of his loss. Because of his contagious enthusiasm for life, limitless generosity, and hilarious sense of humor, board meetings and trail work activities were always a blast. The world will be a darker place without Ben, but the lives he touched will be brighter because of the kindness and joy he left behind.</p><p>The SnoBusters are truly sorry for the passing of such a remarkable person, Ben. Our deepest thoughts go out to his loved ones. After a valiant struggle following a stroke, Ben, 65, of Rocky Hill, gently passed away on December 11, 2023. He married Carol DeJohn, whom he adored for 42 years, and was born in Hartford on November 18, 1958. After getting his start in the industry working for his family’s DeJohn Builders, Ben went on to build Rocky Hill Enterprises.</p><p>He was very involved in the Wilmington, Vermont community via his love of snowmobiling and his pleasure in trail maintenance with the Woodford SnoBusters. Carol, his beloved wife, Mark and Christopher, their children, and a large circle of cherished relatives, including Gene DeJohn, his brother, and numerous nieces, nephews, and in-laws will remember him fondly. Ben’s influence reached well beyond his immediate family, touching the lives of his friends, coworkers, and neighbors.</p><p>On December 15, memorial services celebrating Ben’s life and work will begin at the D’Esopo Funeral Chapel in Wethersfield. An appropriate memorial to Ben’s enthusiasm and commitment would be monetary donations to the Woodford SnoBusters Snowmobile Club rather than flowers. We will always remember Ben DeJohn for the joy he brought to everyone’s lives, his infectious laughter, and his sharp mind. The memory of his life, which was full of joy and appreciated by many, will endure in perpetuity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiao5x7prDUZ62nZ5Kau26wxKOmoaZdpK%2BqwNSaqbJlkpq5sMLEnWSbp5GnsW65xKaZnqpdpLNuwMeeZLCnn5mzsL7DZqqnp5KqwLWx0axkqJ5dq7Kzuc6nq2agkah6sa3SrJydZZGsrrp5w56YraBdqbWmedaoqaWcXaSvqsDSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
