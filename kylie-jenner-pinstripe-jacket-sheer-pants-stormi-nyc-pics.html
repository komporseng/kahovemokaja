On May 3 the 21-year-old left The Mark Hotel wearing a look that was all business on top and pure sexy on the bottom. She wore a low-cut black blazer with white pinstripes that grazed the top of her thighs. Then she added a ton of sparkle with see-through crystal mesh pants that made her legs completely glitter.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Being the makeup wiz that she is, Kylie wore a bright red lip with heavy dark eyebrows to help make the look even more dramatic. She accessorized with small hoop earrings and wore her hair back in a super long bubble ponytail that went all the way down to her slim waist. Kylie wasn’t alone though, as she brought her adorable 14-month-old daughter <strong>Stormi Webster</strong> along for her evening out. The toddler wore black leather pants and a black sweatshirt as Kylie cradled her little one in her arms while a burly bodyguard walked behind them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Kylie appears to be the first family member in the Big Apple ahead of the Met Gala, as sister <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> will also be attending but was photographed on May 3 out and about in Malibu, CA. She wore a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>skin-tight white maxi-dress</a> and has revealed to fans that she’s been on a strict vegan plant-based diet to look her absolute best in her Met Ball gown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kylie-jenner-rocks-pinstripe-jacket-shows-off-her-legs-in-sheer-pants-on-night-out-in-nyc-embed-01.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kylie-jenner-rocks-pinstripe-jacket-shows-off-her-legs-in-sheer-pants-on-night-out-in-nyc-embed-02.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>In 2018, Kylie had shed nearly all of her baby weight in time for the Met Gala after Stormi’s Feb. 1 birth that year. She and “hubby” <strong>Travis Scott</strong> hit their first official red carpet as a couple and both of them looked so fierce. Kylie rocked a strapless tight black <strong>Alexander Wang</strong> gown with a giant torso cutout that showed off her flat tummy. Travis killed it in an all-black suit with a leather belt and chains. Hopefully the pair will make the 2019 Met Gala a couple’s night out again and we can wait to see what fashion they bring!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH12e49tZqSxnJ6ybrbEp6Weql2ltq%2B%2F06ugqZ1dn66kt8StZKyglZq%2FbrzAp6usZaOpvLO5yGalsptdpbakv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
