According to her bio, “Donie has been dancing her entire life, and she studied dance performance in college. This top performer and her partner, Iliah Vinikovskiy, are determined to show the judges that she’s one of the best dancers in the country. While she may not have a “typical” dancer’s physique, Donie fears the judges are rating her appearance more than her ability. Currently, single, Donie’s obsession with dance leaves her little room for finding a partner off the floor.”</p><p>Bravo’s Dancing Queens explores the drama that exists in ballroom dancing.
