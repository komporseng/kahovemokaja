O’Brien is conspicuously missing, although Tyler Hoechlin and Arden Cho remain in the cast. Returning cast members include Tyler Posey, Crystal Reed, Holland Roden, Shelley Hennig, and Colton Haynes.</p><h2>Dylan O’Brien’s exit from Teen Wolf caused quite a stir on the internet.</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dylan-OBrien-2.jpg alt="Dylan O'Brien" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Teen Wolf is a worldwide cultural phenomenon with one of the most passionate fan bases. Fans were saddened when O’Brien quit the show, and many vented their disgust and sadness on Twitter. Fans voiced their frustrations through the ever-popular Euphoria memes. Taylor Swift’s All Too Well: The Short Film stills were also utilized. Swift’s picture stars O’Brien as the protagonist. Fans understand that O’Brien’s exit is understandable since he may not want his career to be defined by his work on Teen Wolf. They had to say goodbye to this cherished cast member, which was understandable. Some bereaved fans petitioned for the film to be canceled since the whole original cast would not be returning.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Teen wolf movie without Dylan O’Brien <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/at0GFTnA3f</a></p><p>— madison | fast times (@DEMIE95) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 15, 2022</a></p><h2>What Dylan O’Brien has lately been up to</h2><p>Following an injury on the production of The Maze Runner: The Death Cure, the actor has taken a little break from the limelight since Teen Wolf.&nbsp;O’Brien was hurt in March 2016 while shooting the Maze Runner’s opening sequence when a harness malfunctioned during a stunt scene. He told The Salt Lake Tribune in September 2017 that the event “damaged most of the right side of my face.” He’s now coming up about how the experience changed his life.</p><p>He stated:</p><p>“I had pals that were so important to me that I felt I had ignored them for years. It became really essential to me, all of a sudden, to foster those ties and not lose them. It fundamentally rewires and restructures the way you perceive your life and what is essential to you, in my opinion.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dylan-OBrien-3.jpg alt="Dylan O'Brien" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Following his recovery from the injury, O’Brien appeared in the 2017 film American Assassin before completing The Maze Runner: The Death Cure in 2018. Since then, the actor has kept a low profile. However, he made a stunning comeback to social media in May 2020 by reacting to one of Halsey’s flashback tweets. He has appeared in the title roles in films such as Love and Monsters and Flashback. He also appeared in the second episode of Season 11 of HBO’s Curb Your Enthusiasm. Dylan O’Brien also acted with Taylor Swift and Sadie Sink in All Too Well: The Short Film, which was released in November 2021. Dylan O’Brien will feature in the forthcoming film The Outfit, released in March 2022, among numerous renowned actors.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibsqSRo3qwrtGinKerXaGyp8CMrZyepl2svK2yjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
