She was serving in the US Army when she decided to launch her skincare brand, Biao Skincare (alternative name Biao Cosmetics and Companies, Inc). According to OpenCorporates, she incorporated the company in May 2019.</p><p>According to her bio in Women Economic Forum, Nicole launched her company while serving in Afghanistan, in the barracks bathroom from a recipe inspired by her grandmother. She did it all from behind a computer desk.</p><p>The grandmother’s old-fashioned remedy that healed her burn scars inspired her to become a skincare entrepreneur. She thinks that the accident and her grandmother’s effective skincare regimen would eventually define her destiny.</p><p>Nicole grew up in a hood and by the age of 16, she had lost seven friends to shooting. She needed a fresh start and moved to her family’s home in Houston. Her teacher during morning homeroom turned on the TV and said, “America is under attack”, it was the 9/11 incident.</p><p>When military recruiters came to her school, because of her curiosity, she talked to the recruiting officers about life in the military. Eventually, she took a test called the ASVAB in downtown Houston. Her mother supported her decision and she joined the Army’s Split Option program.</p><p>Four months after graduation, Nicole landed the job as an armorer—the occupation responsible for maintaining and managing a unit’s weapons—and she went to war. Her first deployment was in Baghdad, Iraq in 2003. She was also working towards earning her Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration which was all paid for by Army Tuition Assistance.</p><p>Later, Nicole was deployed to Afghanistan. It was then the idea started in her and she started working to create a product. To market her product, she started a website and made her first sales in February 2012. Four months later, she sold $75,000 in products.</p><p>Nicole left active duty in 2012 after 13 years of active service. She retired as a sergeant. After leaving the military, she worked at an engineering firm in Houston to fund her business.</p><p>Eventually, she left her day job to go back to school and became a licensed aesthetician. She approached Shark Tank with the idea but faced rejection. She halted the sales and retool. The company stopped running its business for four years.</p><p>Nicole had grit, determination, and self-discipline, the traits she learned in the army. It proved pivotal while launching the business. They saw promise and Nicole attended a Stanford Ignite certification program and then moved cross-country to New York City so she could attend Veterans Future Lab, a business incubator run by the New York University Tandon School of Engineering.</p><p>Nicole sought investments for a reimagined Biao that would transform it into a skincare technology and subscription service company. A group of seven investors pitched in $150K while Houston offered $750K. She expected $750,000 in revenue the year she started the business and hoped to make $2 million in sales and grow the business by 15 percent annually after that.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Much Is Nicole Baldwin Net Worth?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Nicole Baldwin’s financial success has blessed her with an accumulated net worth of $2 Million.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Nicole Baldwin Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>According to her Instagram post, Nicole Baldwin celebrates her birthday on 20 March.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Nicole Baldwin From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Real name Eboni Nicole Baldwin, Nicole is currently based in Katy, Texas.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmp6GTpLmmecGao52vmaN6o7XOZpignV2dsqqzx61kp52kYsSwvtOhZKadXaS%2FbsDHnmSmnZ6qfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
