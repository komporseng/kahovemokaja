Although the actor is commonly known for his role in "Riverdale," he has a few acting credits to his name and shared the screen with an Oscar winner.</p><p class=Fg>On March 28, Charles took to Instagram to share a photo of himself in a white tank top and brown pants as he posed in a kitchen with his arms crossed. The actor completed his look with two layered necklaces and humorously <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqV_opfPr1b>captioned</a> the post, "Spaghettios coming up."</p><p class=Fg>The Instagram post received nearly 60,000 likes at the time of publication, and one fan <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqV_opfPr1b>commented</a>, "So handsome." Another <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqV_opfPr1b>shared</a>, "Definitely one of my favorite photos," and a third <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqV_opfPr1b>added</a>, "YOUR HAIR AH."</p><p class=Fg>In the post, Charles tagged his sister Tammie Melton, who was responsible for the fan-favorite picture. On her Instagram story, she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/tammieymelton/?hl=en">revealed</a>, "S/o to 20 year old me for getting the cannon g7x in 2019 (sic)." Although she only had one photo on her page at the time of writing, the famous star's sister had over 10,000 followers at the time of publication.</p><p class=Fg>Growing up, the siblings and their family moved around a lot due to their father's job in the arm. Charles was born in Juneau, Alaska, and lived in Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Texas throughout <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/1120197/details-about-charles-melton-for-every-riverdale-fan/>his life</a>. During an interview, the actor referred to himself as "an army brat" and once spent five years in Seoul, South Korea.</p><p class=Fg>Following their stay in Asia, the Melton family relocated to Illesheim, Germany. Four years later, Charles attended high school and briefly enrolled at a college in Kansas. During his college days, the actor had a promising career as a football player.</p><p class=Fg>But after coming actress a radio ad about a chance "to be a star," he quit college and moved to Los Angeles to pursue <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6217576/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">an acting career.</a> However, things went differently than planned, as the actor found himself in the modeling industry for two years in New York.</p><p class=Fg>But after landing a minor role in "Glee," Charles got his big break in 2017 when he was cast to co-star in "Riverdale." According to <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/riverdale-season-7-everything-to-know-about-the-final-season/>reports</a>, the hit CW series is set to release its final season this year, offering fans one last chance to see Charles' character alongside <a class="Xd a" href=#>Cole Sprouse</a> and <a class="Xd a" href=#>Lili Reinhart's</a> characters.
