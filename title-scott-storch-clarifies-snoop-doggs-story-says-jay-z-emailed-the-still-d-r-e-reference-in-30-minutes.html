He was on the other side of the door. And the way the studio was set up, there was a control room, and then it was like a kitchen right outside of it. He was in there, making a sandwich or something. And he had the drum pattern that he programmed which is left on play on the MPC. He just let it loop and he would let us all jam out and see if anything comes from it. And he opened the door, he’s like, ‘That’s it right there. That’s it.’ His ears are so dope. Dre was like, ‘This is it. This is a single.’ And he was so excited that he ran back in and we fucking recorded it, and we started layering it together, and just boom.”</p><p></p><p>To this date “Still D.R.E.” is 4x platinum and resonates with Hip Hop heads everywhere, including Jonah Hill, according to Storch.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I have recently spoken with Jonah Hill and he said that ‘Still D.R.E.’ is probably the most iconic piano line in the history of music.
