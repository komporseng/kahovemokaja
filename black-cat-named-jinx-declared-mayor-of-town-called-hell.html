She doesn’t have a condition and the vet says she’s healthy. She just has these birth defects. She’s also not as agile as most cats and is a little clumsy. She only learned how to land on her feet a year ago,” she explained.</p><p>Jinx’s campaign began when Mia asked social media how her fascinating feline friend might become more infamous.</p><p>“I made a joke on Twitter saying, ‘Imagine Jinx will run for president.’ I had also seen animal mayors before, and I sent a tweet out asking how to make Jinx mayor, and someone mentioned Michigan and that you could pay to be mayor of Hell for a day,” she said.</p><p>The privilege of mayor of Hell includes a mayoral proclamation certificate, a Hell souvenir mug, a shirt — and one square inch of property there.</p><p>As is part of the deal, the $100 also earns the public servant automatic impeachment after their day in power has concluded — which is also commemorated with a second certificate.</p><p>Anyone, human or animal, can be mayor of Hell for a day, said Reverend Vonn of Hell, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the town’s minister</a> who swore in the political pussycat — a first for Hell — via telephone proclamation. “Our Mayor of the Day package is the perfect gift for those who are hard to buy for and/or have everything. They get to have one Helluva fun day, and at the end of it, will receive the dreaded phone call to be impeached,” Vonn told MLive.com.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Jinx_campaign_illustration_Instagram.png><p>Mia livestreamed part of the cat’s 24-hour term <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Twitch</a> to an audience of thousands.</p><p>Jinx made several bizarre proclamations for the day, including her intention to ban eggs (“She doesn’t like eggs”), fill all bar establishments with only ranch dressing and implement a 200% tax rate.</p><p>“She did not tell me what she plans on doing with the money, but I think it’s not good,” Mia added. “I don’t know what her intentions are, but we can only hope.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j21ma21fl7mir8pmmpqsXaOurrHDZqGipqhisaavy5qpnpxdoq66u9Fmpp9lpKTEr3nCmqOlnZRitaa4y2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
