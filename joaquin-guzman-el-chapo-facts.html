But the fact is that Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán's life has been far from ordinary, even by drug lord standards.</p><p>Nicknamed "El Chapo" ("Shorty" in Spanish) for his 5'6" frame, Joaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera began his journey to the top of the drug world in his early teens as a successful marijuana dealer in the 1970s.</p><p>He eventually moved up to cocaine dealing in western Mexico under the guidance of drug kingpin <a href=# rel=noopener>Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo</a>. It was after Gallardo's capture in the 1980s that Guzmán truly stepped up to the big leagues of international drug trafficking and expanded the notorious Sinaloa Cartel.</p><p>Before long, Guzmán was making a name for himself as one of the country's most powerful drug traffickers — and putting himself on the radar of both Mexican and U.S. law enforcement agencies in the process.</p><p>Soon, Guzmán would spend eight years in prison during the 1990s before escaping in 2001. But even when he was behind bars, his cartel continued to grow in power. In the decade following his escape, he rose to the level of infamy of historic kingpins like <a href=# rel=noopener>Pablo Escobar</a>. And at one point, he was responsible for trafficking nearly a quarter of the world's illegal drugs.</p><p>But he fell from that perch after being captured by police in 2014. Though he managed to escape again, he was soon <a href=# rel=noopener>recaptured</a> in 2016. From that point onward, he has remained in custody in the United States.</p><p>However, even though Joaquín Guzmán has now been caught, his shocking and disturbing legacy will probably never fade away. Discover the most unbelievable facts about his life in the gallery above.</p><p>After looking through these facts about Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, learn about <a href=#>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada García</a>, the new leader of the Sinaloa Cartel.
